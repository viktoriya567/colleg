        <div class="text5">Data Scientist</div>
        <div class="text4">The level of s/p — 170 thousand rubles (according to the portal HeadHunter.ru). One of the most popular and promising IT professions, which has become especially relevant in the light of the rapid development of services using machine learning technologies and artificial intelligence systems based on neural networks. Data scientists are engaged in big data analytics (they find patterns and draw useful conclusions for their company based on them) and, in addition to programming, they have many other skills, knowledge and abilities.</div>
        <div class="text4">Data scientists pay special attention to mathematics and statistics: without their knowledge, an ordinary programmer, of course, will be able to offer a method for solving a business problem, but whether this method will be optimal is a big question. </div>
        <div class="text5">Developer in Python</div>
        <div class="text4">The level of s/p — 145 thousand rubles (according to the data HeadHunter.ru). A specialist in this field — "and the reader, and the reaper, and on the duda igrets". Develop a website, parse data with Yandex WordStat, create a chatbot-the list of tasks that the "python" can handle is huge. Python is considered to be one of the simplest development languages, and it will be easy for those who already have experience in programming to move into a new profession. By the way, many well-known services are developed in Python-like YouTube or Instagram.</div>
        <div class="text4">In parallel with the main language, you will need to learn some frameworks and understand how databases work-in order to take on more interesting tasks. Python, like any other programming language, requires perseverance and care.</div>
        <div class="text5">Data Analyst</div>
        <div class="text4">The level of s/p — 130 thousand rubles (according to the data HeadHunter.ru). This profession is for those who enjoy their perfectionism and believe that their analytical abilities should be shown in full force. Data analysts help a company set up a Business Intelligence (BI) class analytical system that generates reports on specified indicators in a split second; data from such a system can be obtained without the involvement of a programmer.</div>
        <div class="text4">And here again, you will need Python, but it alone will not be enough to work as an analyst. Analysts do not need to create full-fledged web applications. They need to be able to solve their own tasks — to process large amounts of data, work with the API of analytical systems, build dashboards, be able to visualize data and bring data from different BI systems to a single format.</div>
