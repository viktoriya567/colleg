        <p class="text5">Forums, conferences, and free resources</p>
        <div class="text4">Such events can take an unprecedented amount of time without any visible result, since in any case you can not or are very limited in choosing only the necessary information, the remaining 90% or more you get "in the load". To keep yourself "in IT shape", you can use this source of knowledge, but it is recommended to limit yourself to a maximum of 5% of the entire training time. Why so little? Because free resources usually provide information not the one that you need, but the one that they want to impose on you). In addition, in training based on free resources, there is no structure of training, that is, the learning process takes place in "flashes" and does not allow you to delve into the topic or draw a parallel through all the available knowledge and group them.</div>
        <p class="text5">Remote self-study on the Internet</p>
        <div class="text4">Online self-study on the Internet is becoming one of the most popular sources of knowledge. This way of learning quickly spread because of its mobility: learning is available at any time from any device, as long as there is Internet. Self-study is often in the form of specially created videos, where the listener is offered a rich multimedia content. It's always nice to learn when the lesson is like a movie, where everything that happens on the screen is shown and explained. In addition to video and audio training, there are simply text modules that display several pages on the screen and you need to read them from the screen.</div>
         <p class="text5">Full-time training</p>
        <div class="text4">Here we come to the most ancient and classical type of training, which was created before the appearance of books – full-time training. Full-time training provides students with MAXIMUM learning opportunities and provides the coach with a full set of tools to achieve a high level of QUALITY. Full-time training should take place in relatively small groups, so that the coach can monitor the progress of each member of the group. In addition, classes of this format involve a closer contact between the coach and the students, which allows you to solve some of the assigned work tasks directly without leaving the classroom. In addition, the coach, analyzing the level of the class, can easily optimize the level of training on the topic and provide either additional material, or vice versa, will focus in more detail on the material that for some reason was not understood and assimilated. Hands-on classes in the classroom also involve and enable the coach to individually intervene and go beyond the templates.</div>
