        <div class="text4">The demand for professions in the information technology environment allows you to work with anyone in your specialty: from a junior assistant engineer to the leader of an entire development team. There is an opportunity to develop not only in programming, but also to become a professional in the field of design, choosing a stylish and exciting profession as a designer or interface developer.</div>
        <div class="text4">Every bank, every firm, and every government agency needs IT specialists. After all, it is impossible to imagine the work of any enterprise without the use of information technology. Qualified programmers, developers, sysadmins, as well as physicists, are highly valued in the international labor market.</div>
        <div class="text4">We should also mention gender equality in the IT industry. To date, the question of who to work for a girl in the field of information technology is not as acute as in other purely male spheres. And although most of the specialists are men, girls perfectly find a common language with clients and cope with any tasks that require a mathematical or analytical mindset. They occupy the lion's share of the IT sector: from designers and programmers to team leaders and company directors.</div>
        <div class="text4">Mastering any profession in the field of information technology is a contribution to the future, which will be built using absolutely all the modern capabilities of the IT industry.</div>
